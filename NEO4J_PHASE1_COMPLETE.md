## Overview

Phase 1 of the Neo4j Graph Configuration System is now complete and operational. This phase establishes the foundation for AI-powered graph model generation and Neo4j integration with RegIntel.

**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** (Phase 1)

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Infrastructure ✅

**Prisma Models Added** (see `packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma`):

- `GraphConfig` - Main configuration records
  - Stores industry profile, goals, context, trusted sources
  - Tracks configuration status (DRAFT → PROPOSED → STAGING → PRODUCTION → ARCHIVED)
  - PostgreSQL schema snapshot for reference

- `GraphConfigVersion` - Versioned graph models
  - Incremental version numbers
  - AI-generated summary, graph model, and mapping rules
  - Cypher templates, Bloom suggestions, NeoDash suggestions
  - QA validation queries
  - Deployment timestamps (staging and production)

- `GraphSyncRun` - Sync execution tracking
  - Tracks backfill, incremental, and validation runs
  - Batch progress and checkpoint data
  - Error logging and status tracking
  - Dry-run support

- `GraphAudit` - Immutable audit logs
  - Records all configuration changes
  - Actor tracking for compliance
  - Metadata for detailed change tracking

**Migration Status**: ✅ Applied to PostgreSQL

### 2. Neo4j Docker Setup ✅

**Container**: `regintel-neo4j`
- **Image**: Neo4j 5.15 Community Edition
- **Ports**:
  - 7474 (Neo4j Browser)
  - 7687 (Bolt protocol)
- **Plugins**: APOC, Graph Data Science (GDS)
- **Database**: `regintel`
- **Credentials**: neo4j / regintel123
- **Memory**:
  - Heap: 512MB - 1GB
  - Page cache: 512MB

**Health Check**: ✅ Passing

```bash
# Start Neo4j
docker-compose -f docker-compose.neo4j.yml up -d

# Check health
curl http://localhost:3001/graph/health
```

### 3. Neo4j Connection Service ✅

**File**: `apps/api/src/services/neo4jService.ts` (343 lines)

**Features**:
- ✅ Driver connection management with connection pooling
- ✅ Staging vs Production environment support
- ✅ Query execution (read and write)
- ✅ Transaction support for atomic operations
- ✅ Automatic staging label prefix injection (`_stg_Drug` → `Drug`)
- ✅ Database statistics (node/relationship counts by label)
- ✅ **QA validation queries with APPROVED DATA enforcement**
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling (SIGTERM/SIGINT)

**Critical QA Queries**:

```typescript
// Query #0: Verify ONLY APPROVED data exists (CRITICAL)
MATCH (n)
WHERE n.approvalStatus IS NOT NULL
  AND n.approvalStatus <> 'APPROVED'
RETURN count(*) as nonApprovedCount
// Expected: 0 records

// Query #7: Verify all nodes have approval metadata
MATCH (n)
WHERE n.approvalStatus IS NULL
   OR n.approvedBy IS NULL
   OR n.approvedAt IS NULL
RETURN count(*) as missingMetadata
// Expected: 0 records
```

**Usage Example**:

```typescript
import { neo4jService } from './services/neo4jService';

// Execute a query
const result = await neo4jService.executeReadQuery(
  'MATCH (n:Drug) RETURN n.name LIMIT 10',
  {},
  'STAGING'
);

// Run QA validation
const validation = await neo4jService.runQAValidation('STAGING');
if (!validation.passed) {
  console.error('QA validation failed:', validation);
}
```

### 4. AI-Powered Graph Proposal Service ✅

**File**: `apps/api/src/services/graphProposalService.ts` (448 lines)

**Features**:
- ✅ Uses OpenAI GPT-4 to generate graph models from plain English
- ✅ Takes admin input: profile, goals, context, trusted sources
- ✅ Generates complete Neo4j graph schema:
  - Node definitions with properties and key strategies
  - Relationship definitions with descriptions
  - PostgreSQL-to-Neo4j mapping rules
  - Bloom visualization suggestions (colors, captions, natural language examples)
  - NeoDash dashboard suggestions (tables, charts, KPIs)
- ✅ **Enforces APPROVED DATA ONLY constraint** in all mapping rules
- ✅ Validates that all PostgreSQL views filter `WHERE status = 'APPROVED'`
- ✅ Saves proposals to database with audit logging

**Example Request**:

```json
{
  "profile": "Regulatory intelligence platform focused on pediatric oncology drug development and approval tracking",
  "goals": [
    "Track FDA and EMA approval decisions for pediatric oncology drugs",
    "Visualize relationships between drugs, clinical trials, and regulatory decisions",
    "Identify trends in regulatory guidance affecting pediatric populations",
    "Monitor safety alerts and warnings related to oncology treatments"
  ],
  "context": "Focus on drugs treating ALL, neuroblastoma, and other pediatric cancers. Track biomarkers, clinical trial phases, and regional approval patterns.",
  "trustedSources": ["fda.gov", "ema.europa.eu", "pmda.go.jp"]
}
```

**Example Response** (Generated Graph Model):

- **Nodes**: Drug, Decision, Trial, SafetyAlert
- **Relationships**: DECIDES_ON, STUDIES, ALERT_FOR
- **Mapping Rules**: 4 rules referencing `vw_approved_*` views
- **Bloom Suggestions**: Colors (#3B82F6 for Drug, #10B981 for Decision, etc.), captions, natural language search examples
- **NeoDash Suggestions**: 3 starter dashboards (Recent Approvals table, Active Clinical Trials bar chart, Safety Alerts pie chart)

### 5. Graph Configuration API ✅

**File**: `apps/api/src/routes/graph.ts` (455 lines)

**Base Path**: `/graph`

**Endpoints**:

#### Health & Monitoring

```bash
# Check Neo4j connection health
GET /graph/health
# Response: { status: "healthy", message: "...", timestamp: "..." }

# Get database statistics (node/relationship counts by label)
GET /graph/stats?environment=STAGING
# Response: { nodeCount: 0, relationshipCount: 0, labelCounts: {...} }

# Run QA validation queries (APPROVED data checks)
GET /graph/qa?environment=STAGING
# Response: {
#   validation: { query0_nonApprovedCount: 0, ... },
#   passed: true,
#   criticalChecks: {
#     approvedDataOnly: "✅ PASSED - All data is APPROVED",
#     approvalMetadata: "✅ PASSED - All nodes have approval metadata"
#   }
# }
```

#### Development/Testing

```bash
# Execute custom read-only Cypher query
POST /graph/query
{
  "query": "MATCH (n:Drug) RETURN n.name LIMIT 10",
  "params": {},
  "environment": "STAGING"
}
# Response: { records: [...], summary: {...} }
# Note: Write operations (CREATE, MERGE, DELETE, etc.) are blocked for security
```

#### AI Proposal Generation

```bash
# Generate an AI-powered graph model proposal
POST /graph/propose
{
  "profile": "Industry/company/focus description",
  "goals": ["Goal 1", "Goal 2", ...],
  "context": "Optional additional context",
  "trustedSources": ["fda.gov", "ema.europa.eu"]
}
# Response: { success: true, proposal: {...}, timestamp: "..." }
```

#### Configuration Management

```bash
# Save a graph configuration with proposal
POST /graph/configs
{
  "name": "Pediatric Oncology Graph v1",
  "input": { profile: "...", goals: [...], ... },
  "proposal": { /* from /propose endpoint */ },
  "createdBy": "user_id"
}
# Response: { success: true, configId: "...", versionId: "..." }

# List all graph configurations
GET /graph/configs
# Response: { configs: [...], count: N }

# Get specific configuration with all versions
GET /graph/configs/:id
# Response: { config: {...}, versions: [...], syncRuns: [...] }
```

### 6. Critical Security: APPROVED DATA ONLY Enforcement ✅

**Documentation**: `NEO4J_APPROVED_DATA_ONLY.md` (235 lines)

**Enforcement at Every Layer**:

1. **PostgreSQL Views** (Source):
   ```sql
   WHERE status = 'APPROVED'
     AND reviewed_at IS NOT NULL
     AND approved_by IS NOT NULL
   ```

2. **Application Layer** (GraphSyncService):
   - Validates filter is present in all queries
   - Logs warnings if non-approved views are referenced

3. **Data Layer** (Neo4j Properties):
   ```cypher
   ON CREATE SET
     n.approvalStatus = 'APPROVED',
     n.approvedBy = $approvedBy,
     n.approvedAt = datetime($approvedAt)
   ```

4. **QA Validation** (Automated Checks):
   - Query #0: Verifies no non-approved data (MUST return 0)
   - Query #7: Verifies all nodes have approval metadata (MUST return 0 missing)

**Why This Matters**:
- ✅ **Trustworthy**: Only vetted content in the graph
- ✅ **Consistent**: All data passed the same review process
- ✅ **Auditable**: Every node has approval metadata
- ✅ **Compliant**: Meets regulatory standards

## Architecture Decisions

### Why MERGE-Only?

Neo4j writes use **MERGE-only** operations (no DELETE/DROP/DETACH):
- ✅ Prevents accidental data loss
- ✅ Enables incremental updates
- ✅ Supports idempotent sync operations
- ✅ Allows safe promotion from staging to production

### Why Staging → Production?

Two environments prevent breaking production:
- **STAGING**: Test data model changes with `_stg_` label prefix
- **PRODUCTION**: Live data with standard labels
- Promotion copies from staging → production without deleting staging

### Why AI-Powered Proposals?

Manual graph modeling is complex and time-consuming:
- ✅ AI generates comprehensive models from plain English descriptions
- ✅ Non-technical admins can design graph schemas
- ✅ Consistent structure and best practices
- ✅ Automatic mapping from PostgreSQL to Neo4j
- ✅ Built-in visualization suggestions

## Known Limitations (Phase 1)

- ⏳ **No Cypher Template Generator** yet (Phase 2)
- ⏳ **No Dry-Run / Diff Engine** yet (Phase 2)
